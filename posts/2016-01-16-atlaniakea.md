Somewhere around my sophomore year of high school, I got in the habit of writing project ideas down. I launched a blog thereafter which now serves as a home for around 3 years of work on various things.

Some of the posts became projects, some never evolved past plans. Anyhoo, [here it is](http://gest-alt.github.io/atlaniakea.io) where it will probably stay for sometime to come.
